    "A recent study confirmed the association between gut microbiota and shifts in host healthy status: The gut microbiota is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression [REF]. Therewith, it holds great potential to investigate whether the progression of CRC could be monitored through the gut microbiota. We assessed such applicability of EXPERT by introducing cancer data from Zeller, G. et al. In this assessment, we considered five stages in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC): 0 (Healthy control) I, II, III, and IV according to the study of Zeller G. et al. We first found that the compositional shifts of the human gut within such progression are invisible to some traditional methods, exemplified by Principle Coordination Analysis (PCoA) using distance metric either in weighted-Unifrac or Jensen Shannon divergence. However, the assessment result of utilizing cross-validation accord with our hypothesis: the progression stage of CRC can be accurately monitored, while an obviously better performance (ROC-AUC over 0.95 for stages from I to IV) was achieved by the model built from the Disease Model. This has proved the superior applicability of EXPERT as a method for early detection of the occurrence of cancers and suggested considerable potential optimization through knowledge transfer in such monitor systems."
