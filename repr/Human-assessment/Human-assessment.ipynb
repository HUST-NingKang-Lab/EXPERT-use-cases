    "We verified the utility of our transfer scheme, including features, model configuration, hyper-parameters, as well as knowledge transfer process, by validating the generalizing performance under two application scenarios: basic quantification of contributions under general application scenario, as well as quantifying human-associated source contributions under context-dependent application scenario. We introduced two datasets in order to systematically assess such performances: a combined dataset consists of 125,827 samples collected from 124 biomes, as well as a human dataset consists of 53,553 samples collected from 27 human-associated biomes. Through random cross-validation, we found that the EXPERT model was  able to quantify source contributions for communities, as well as qualitatively identify the biome sources for communities, confirmed the utility of our transfer scheme in such context-dependent applications. \n",
    "We also characterized the impact of knowledge transfer and fine-tune optimization on such context-dependent application in three facets: efficiency, accuracy, as well as the variance of accuracy. The result shown that the knowledge transfer scheme with finetune optimization can contribute to both the robustness and the accuracy of the model, enabled more robust quantification of source contributions as well as more accurate identification the biome sources of these query samples compared to independent optimization. Notably, the fine-tune optimizaiton process comes up with a cost: Three times as much time is spent on performing this optimization. This is largely due to the low learning rate (1 x 10-5) utilized by fine-tuning process. But considering the robustness and  accuracy optimization of fine-tuning process, we defined fine-tuning as a default setting in the following sections. \n",
    "We further assessed the performance of a recent source tracking method, FEAST, on the same sets of datasets. We only considered the bottom layer of the human ontology as potential sources, as FEAST cannot handle the association between sources. We also have to trade its accuracy off for the completion of the experiment in an acceptable time (30 days): we considered randomly selected xxx samples for each biome as potential sources for FEAST. Results have shown that FEAST was indeed much slower than EXPERT, while the accuracies of FEAST was also lower than EXPERT, which were largely bottlenecked when faced with large ammount of samples. Considering that SourceTracker was more than ten times slower than FEAST while had similar accuracies [REF], we deemed EXPERT to be both faster and more accurate than both of these two unsupervised learning methods."
